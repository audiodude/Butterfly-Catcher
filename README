Butterfly Catcher: A simple 80s-arcade style game using the pygame framework.

Currently a prototype/proof of concept.

Installing and running:
Note: This game is launched from the command line, and requires manual
installation of the pygame framework.

You will need to install the pygame framework, available for all major
platforms at <http://pygame.org>. Developed on version 1.9.1, with heavy use
of the Sprite module which I believe was introduced in 1.8.

Once you've installed pygame, simply run the script with the command:
$ python butterfly_catcher.py


Game Instructions:
<LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN> = move the Net/Paddle
<X> = rotate the Net/Paddle clockwise
<Z> = rotate the Net/Paddle anti-clockwise
